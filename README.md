# LiteratureReviewer
Conducting literature review requires active searching, filtering and organization. Needless to say, it's a lot of effort. An experienced researcher may know well about the history and development of his/her field. But for a research rookie, navigating through the sea of existing literature is more challenging.

1. Literature Retrieval
2. Network Analysis
   Helps identifying the relation between literature
3. Development Summary and Trend Analysis
