# LiteratureReviewer
Conducting literature review requires active searching, filtering and organization. Needless to say, it's a lot of effort. An experienced researcher may know well about the history and development of his/her field. But for a research rookie, navigating through the sea of existing literature is more challenging.  

LiteratureReviewer is an effort for a more efficient literature review process. It has the following functionalities:

1. Literature Retrieval: Integrate ArXivs, JSTOR and other hubs for literatures into one page. Search papers and download painlessly
2. Network Analysis: Helps to identify the relation (citations, similarities) among literature
3. Development Summary and Trend Analysis: Creates a roadmap of the key findings on a certain topic
4. Next Paper to Read: A Customizable Recommendation System
